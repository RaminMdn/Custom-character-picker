# Custom Character Picker 

A **lightweight, compact and handy tool** to quickly pick and copy **special characters or your choice** that are not available on a standard keyboard — perfect for creating folder trees, diagrams, or tables in places like **GitHub READMEs**.

</div>

## 🧭 Purpose

If you're someone who frequently uses line-drawing characters or other special symbols for:

- 📁 Creating **folder trees** in `README.md` files
- 📊 Making **ASCII-style diagrams or tables**
- 🎨 Enhancing documentation or plain-text layouts

...this tool saves you from searching symbols or using difficult `ALT + CODE` combinations every time.

## 📷 Example Use Case

Here’s a simple GitHub-style folder tree:

```
📦Project
 ├── 📁src
 │   └── main.py
 ├── 📁docs
 └── README.md
```

<br>

And here you may see how creating a tree and a table with the special characters added in the app looks in Notepad++:

<br>

<div style="align: center;" align="center">
<img style="width: 80%; display: inline-block;" alt="img" src="https://github.com/RaminMdn/Custom-character-picker/blob/main/Image%20material/1%20(5).png"/>
</div>

<br><br>

## 🖱️ How It Works

1. Launch the app (`character_picker.py`).
2. Click on the symbol you want to use.
3. Press **"Copy"**.
4. Paste it anywhere (in your code, README, etc.)!

<br><br>

## 📌 Always on Top Mode

Enable the **"Always on top"** checkbox to keep the picker window floating above all other windows — perfect for multitasking while writing documentation.

---
<br><br>

## ⚙️ Customization

You can replace the default characters with any symbols of your choice!

### 🔧 How?

Open the Python file and locate this line near the top:

```python
CHARACTERS = ['├', '│', '└', '─', '|', '\\']
```

Replace the list with any characters you frequently use. For example:

```python
CHARACTERS = ['✓', '✗', '★', '→', '§']
```

## Author’s Note

This project was developed as part of personal learning and practice.

At times, I consult pair programming tools, programming forums or relevant documentations — for purposes like:

- Proofreading code or comments
- Double-checking best practices
- Exploring alternative implementations

These tools were used in the same way any developer might use a second pair of eyes, and never as a substitute for understanding or authorship.

The goal was always clarity, correctness, and learning — with every line written and reviewed consciously and deliberately.
